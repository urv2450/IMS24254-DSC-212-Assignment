DSC-212-Assignment

This assignment explores community detection within Zachary's Karate Club network using the spectral modularity maximization method. The objective is to partition the graph into distinct social groups by analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the modularity matrix. The workflow encompasses implementing a custom spectral clustering algorithm, visualizing the resulting partitions, and quantitatively evaluating node importance using various centrality metrics.
